Reporting Tools
===============
Tools that make my life slightly easier

Configuration
-------------
Edit the ``weekly_config.py`` and adapt it to your teams.

Bug Summaries
-------------
Run weekly-bugs.py with the name for the team you want to generate the report about. For instance:
```./weekly-bugs.py ui```

Reviewing Summaries
-------------------
Likewise, Gerrit activity reports are generated by running `weekly-reviews.py`. For example:
```./weekly-bugs.py lab```
